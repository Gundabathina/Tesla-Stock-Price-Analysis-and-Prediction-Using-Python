# Tesla Stock Price Analysis and Prediction Using Python

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and prediction of Tesla's stock prices using various machine learning and time series models. The dataset contains historical stock data, including features like 'Open,' 'Close,' 'High,' 'Low,' and 'Volume,' and was analyzed to gain insights and make predictions about future stock performance.

# Key Highlights:
### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: 
Cleaned and transformed the dataset to extract relevant features such as rolling averages, median absolute deviation (MAD), and outliers detection.
 ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Numeric statistics and visualizations (histograms, box plots) to understand the distribution and trends in stock prices.
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps to identify relationshipsbetween key financial metrics like Volume and Closing prices.
 ### Predictive Modeling:
- Implemented Linear Regression to model and predict Tesla's stock prices based on volume.
- Utilized ARIMA time series model for predicting future stock prices and assessed the model's performance using mean squared error (MSE).
#### Technical Analysis:
-  Applied technical indicators like Moving Averages (10-day and 50-day SMAs) and analyzed stock price trends over time.
### Event Impact Analysis:
-  Visualized the stock price movements during key events like product announcements and earnings releases.
### Value at Risk (VaR): 
- Estimated potential losses for a given investment with 95% confidence using historical daily returns.
### Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- ARIMA for time series forecasting
### Visualizations
### Stock Price Trends:
- Plots displaying stock price fluctuations over time with moving averages.
### Correlation Heatmaps: 
- Analyzing the relationships between features such as Volume, Close, and Price Change.
- Outliers Detection: Box plots identifying outliers in Tesla's stock prices.
- Stock Price Prediction: Predicted future prices using ARIMA, visualizing both actual and predicted values.
